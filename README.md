# Miscellaneous ML Projects

## Introduction

This repository will host some small machine learning projects that don't necessarily need to be hosted separately.
These projects are mostly there to test my understanding of the various courses and guided projects I have done.

## Projects

### Cat classifier using logistic regression

This is a NumPy implementation of a logistic regression as a neural network with a single neuron. It predict if the image contains a cat or not. This is inspired by the programming assignment of the Deep Learning Specialization from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (the dataset comes from there too).
